## Description

This is my portfolio created with React. It contains a short bio, a list of my projects, and a contact form. It also has links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, as well as my resume. Was a joy to work on, react is so much fun. Hope y'all enjoy! 

## Technologies Used

Primarily used react and the frameworks that come with it. For styling, I used tailwind css as its the css framework I'm most familiar with. Also used react-router-dom for the routing.
